🌐 **Full Stack Web Development**

**Full Stack Web Development** is the process of building complete web applications — from the **user interface (frontend)** to the **server and database (backend)**.

A **Full Stack Developer** is someone who works on both:

* 🎨 **Frontend (Client-side)** — everything users see and interact with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.)
* ⚙️ **Backend (Server-side)** — logic, databases, APIs, authentication, etc. (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, etc.)

🧩 Together, these two sides create seamless web experiences — from visually appealing layouts to secure, high-performance data management.
